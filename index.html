        <p><strong>Principal's message</strong></p>
        <strong>"Be the wise, the faithful, the loving and the capable!"</strong><br><br>
        We have had some painful times over the past two years due to the Coronavirus situation.
        I encourage students, parents, and teachers who have had this difficult time.
        This coronavirus situation has become the hardest time for children. During this period,
        most children lost their chance to learn because they couldn't go to school.
        Some children had to go to shops or workplaces to make money. And some young girls had to
        marry for the livehood of their parents and their families. This is very sad
        and heartbreaking. I majored in education at a Korean university. I learned about how
        important education is in human life through studing education. Korea was also
        a very poor country after the war. However, Korean parents did their best to educate their
        children, even though they are poor. As a result, their children, who were
        well educated by their parents' efforts, did not have to live in poverty anymore.
        Education is not just necessary to avoid living in poverty. Through education, people
        get wisdom and knowledge. Educated people can prepare for the future and create a reliable world.
        They know how to love people and become capable porple and change the world.
        Our Gloria School will do our best to edycate our students to be the wise, the faithful,
        the loving and the capable.<br>
        I pray that God's blessings will always be with you.</div>
